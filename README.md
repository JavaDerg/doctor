# Doctor
Doctor is a dll injector.
You can inject dlls into running software with this.
Thats all.

(Normaly I would release all my tools under a open source licence, but because skids tend to steal such tools this is closed source and obfuscated (enough) until I found a better solution)

## Features
- Inject dlls
- List running processes
- Signature change (you can change the signature of this software with a mouse click)

## Screenshots? Yes!
